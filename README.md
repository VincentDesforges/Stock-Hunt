## Disclaimer
I wrote this code primarily for fun and also to help myself out when selecting stocks. I cannot guarranty the soundess of the calculations, or whether it would result in any impovement in investment performance.

Please do not make investment decisions on this tool alone. Many factors relevant to a company's suitability as an investment are not considered in this calculation (e.g. debt levels, management, sector trends...).

## Thanks
Thank you for coming to see my code!
